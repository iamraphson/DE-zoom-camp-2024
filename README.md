# Data Engineering ZoomCamp 2024

This repo contains homework, notes and final project(s) for the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) by [Datatalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/).


Each week I completed a series of [videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb) and followed this up with homework exercises.

## Tools

We used a range of tools:
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io): Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com): Containerization
* [SQL](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com): Data Analysis & Exploration
